solace-pubsub-python
====================

A project template demonstrating how you can use Python's ctypes library to
interface with the Solace Messaging C API. Useful if you are writing a Python
application and don't want to expose your IP address to use the REST API or if
you are looking to avoid the overhead of HTTP.

This template is based off of Solace's Publish/Subscribe tutorial.

This project is not affiliated with Solace in any way and was done in my own
interest.
