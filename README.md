solace-pubsub-python
====================

A project template demonstrating how you can use Python's ctypes library to
interface with the Solace Messaging C API. Useful if you are writing a Python
application and don't want to expose your IP address to use the REST API or if
you are looking to avoid the overhead of HTTP.

This template is based off of Solace's Publish/Subscribe tutorial found here:

https://github.com/SolaceSamples/solace-samples-c

This project is not affiliated with Solace in any way and was done in my own
interest. This project will also never be maintained and as such, will never
expose the entire API. What it aims to accomplish is to serves as a proof of
concept/starting point for any further work using Solace with Python.


Dependencies
